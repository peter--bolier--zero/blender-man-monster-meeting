Created monster based on cubes. Tried to mix with cylinders but somehow it didn't look better than all cubes.

part 5, finish the beast and created overall scene.

Added all to one scene, using copy paste - need to check how to append objects easiliy later. Monster is a bit different but looks ok.

Part 6 - finishing scene, i.e lighting.

Note: lighting is still not quite good yet, takes some more tweaking.

Moved on to add a rotating camera.

Changed path to ellipse just to see if it looks better.

Note: initially forgot to change the file format so the renderer generated 250 jpegs instaed of a movie. So dont forget the check the fileformat besides the folder where the movie is to be stored.
